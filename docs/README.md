## Project Summary

**Goal:** Build an automated trading bot that profits from Polymarket US sports markets by:
1. Reacting to live game events faster than the market (arbitrage)
2. Providing liquidity and earning spreads (market making)
3. Finding mispriced lines vs sportsbooks (statistical edge)

**Starting Capital:** $1,000
**Primary Market:** NBA
**Mode:** Paper trading first, then live

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Language | Python 3.11+ | Fast development, your expertise |
| Database | SQLite | Simple, no setup needed |
| Hosting | AWS EC2 us-east-1 | Low latency to Polymarket |
| Sports Data | ESPN (free) → OpticOdds (paid) | Start free, upgrade when profitable |

---

## Deployment (Phase 7)

Use the repo’s Docker assets (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) and the
deployment helpers under `deploy/` (systemd unit, CloudWatch config, backup
script). Full steps are in `05_INFRASTRUCTURE.md`.

Minimum environment variables:

- `PM_API_KEY_ID`
- `PM_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `MARKET_SLUGS`

Common optional settings:

- `TRADING_MODE`, `INITIAL_BALANCE`
- Risk: `RISK_MAX_POSITION_PER_MARKET`, `RISK_MAX_PORTFOLIO_EXPOSURE`,
  `RISK_MAX_DAILY_LOSS`, `RISK_KELLY_FRACTION`, `RISK_MIN_EDGE`,
  `RISK_MIN_TRADE_SIZE`, `RISK_MAX_CORRELATED_EXPOSURE`,
  `RISK_MAX_POSITIONS`, `RISK_MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT`
- Logging: `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_FILE`, `LOG_JSON`
- Health: `HEALTH_HOST`, `HEALTH_PORT`

| Max Drawdown | < 10% |
| Profitable Days | > 60% |

`pytest -v`

Integration tests (opt-in; requires PM_API_KEY_ID and PM_PRIVATE_KEY in .env):
`RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 pytest -m integration -v`

## Important Notes

1. **Tennis Markets:** You mentioned tennis, but Polymarket US documentation only shows NFL, NBA, NHL, and college football. Verify tennis availability before building tennis-specific features.

2. **Paper Trade First:** The system includes a paper trading mode. Use it for at least 2 weeks before risking real money.

3. **Start Small:** Even after paper trading, start live trading with only $100-200 until you're confident.

4. **API Limits:** Polymarket US has limits (5 WS connections, 100 markets/subscription). The architecture accounts for this.

5. **Latency Matters:** For live arbitrage, every millisecond counts. Start with the free ESPN API for paper trading, then upgrade to paid data when profitable.
